# NLPers-Help-NLPers

In the era of "Big Model," the territory for NLPers to thrive is becoming increasingly limited. As a result, we aim to provide support to NLPers through the "NLPers help NLPers" approach, hoping to spark new inspiration and opportunities.

## Embracing the Big Model

Repo: Awesome-LLM [[github]](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM)

Expanding the capabilities and properties of models, rather than just skooching up benchmark numbers.

- How do you make language models stateful? How can models learn from their experiences? How can we do few shot learning in a way that updates parameters and doesn't require dumping stuff into the context buffer?

- How is information stored in an LLM? How can you efficiently edit this information? Can you design architectures that make this information representation explicit?

- (multilingual)
How do you change/expand the input language of model without fully retraining it? Can you do this through fine-tuning?

- How is the performance of large models predicted by that of smaller ones?

## Data is All You Need

Better benchmarks, Better strategy for obtaining clean data. 

- Dataset quality seems to matter more than model size. How do we measure the quality of a dataset? How do we prune the junk without a ton of human effort? Can curriculum learning speed up training for LLMs (it definitely does for humans)?

## Last Mile of NLP

LLM has successfully resolved 95% of the issues, yet the remaining 5% is crucial in providing a direct and constructive impact on people's lives. The question remains: How can we overcome the "last mile" problem and unleash the full potential of existing technologies?

- Do you want to facilitate users' information needs with precise information (e.g., instead of inflating the answer with something irrelvant)?

## AI Safety/Alignment

Course: https://course.mlsafety.org/




- What are the security vulnerabilities of API accessible models? Can the weights be extracted efficiently? Can you infer the architecture from adversarial inputs/outputs?

- Do you want to test whether NLP models satisfy certain privacy and fairness constrains (instead of trusting a black-box model)?









- **Transparency:** Transparency tools offer insight into LLM's inner workings. Enhanced interpretability helps with anticipating failure modes of LLMs and identifying what caused them to make a decision.

- **Anomaly detection plays a vital role in identifying various hazards:** out-of-distribution inputs, model misuse, proxy gaming, sudden behavioral shifts, and unanticipated failure modes. Early detection of anomalies greatly improves model reliability in real-world situations.

- **Trojans:** Adversaries can implant hidden functionality into ML models, which can trigger unexpected harmful behaviors. Studying trojans sheds light on detecting and removing dangerous hidden behaviors, ultimately leading to safer and more secure models.

- **Proxy Gaming:** Recent LLMs are trained using RL to optimize potentially fragile reward models. Can we improve the robustness of reward model proxies to optimization pressure from the policy? Alternatively, can we detect when reward models are being gamed?

- **Adversarial Robustness:** Future agents may be guided by neural network proxies such as networks that model human values. If those proxies are LLMs, can we ensure that they are robust to optimization pressure and adversarial inputs?

- **Model Honesty:** Models have been observed to lie in games like Diplomacy, which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. Research on encouraging models to honestly report their beliefs is key to fostering trust & improving the reliability of AI systems.
